# yolov3_visualstudio2015_cpu
The run-time system: 
    Windows10 + x64  + Visual_Studio2015

You only need to download the yolov3 weights : 
          https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ 

No need other lib or configuration 

However the cpu version is time-consuming.

Because Windows system is different from time function of Linux system, there may be timing error in engineering. I didn't seriously modify the timing function part, I'm sorry.
